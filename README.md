PicNSip Photogrpahy Portfolio is a site that shows off my photography skills. The site is a portfoloio of all my work throughout the year during the panedmic. I only started studying photography during the covid panedmic but it has always been an interest of mine. Photography helped me get through the panedmic. It made me go out and explore & see things through a camera lens.

## PNS Logo
The PicNSnip logo was design by myself using a different platform called cava. I have used canva a number of different times for creating and designing social media graphics, presentations, posters, documents and other visual content.


## Features 
PicNsnip site consits of four pages with idenitcal navigaition and footer styles. 
Each page will show case a different photo from my own collection.

### Exsiting-features

#### Navigation Bar

This featured is on all four pages, the naviagation bar includes links logo, Home page, Photography page, About and Contact page and is consistent on each page to allow the user to easily navigate from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

# 

#### Home page

The home page only inlcudes one main photo, this photo acts as a hero image. This photo sits on a black back ground which makes the photo stand out because it is a Black & White photo. I am hoping users will want to see more after just visiting the home page. Keeping it very minimalist in style. 

This hero image is only an intriduction to my work!

# 

#### The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for PicNSnip. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer also inclubes a video link icon and a signature. The video link shows my fun side in life, capturing moments in time when I dont have a camera. I didn't want to included a page for the video because it didn't fix into the style and purpose of the page. The page is to showcase my photography.


The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

I have tested that this page works in different browers chromne, firefox, safari. 
This page is also responsive to a number of devices. 

#### Unfixed Bugs
I have a few issues with my responsive screen sive to a moblie phone. It works fine in landscape view on a moblie phone. I have been going back and front trying to sort out the responsive issues I have. 

Image size, some of my photos are quite big in size. I have tried to reduce the size of all the photos and some are still too big, cause page to perform slowly.
