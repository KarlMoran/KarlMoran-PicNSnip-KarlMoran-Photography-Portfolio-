PicNSip Photogrpahy Portfolio is a site that shows off my photography skills. The site is a portfoloio of all my work throughout the year during the panedmic. I only started studying photography during the covid panedmic but it has always been an interest of mine. Photography helped me get through that the panedmic. I had to go out and explore & see things through a camera lens.

### Exsiting-features
Navigation Bar

This featured is on all four pages, the naviagation bar includes links logo, Home page, Photography page, About and Contact page and is consistent on each page to allow the user to easily navigate from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

Home page

The home page only inlcudes one main photo, this photo acts as a hero image. This photo sits on a black back ground which makes the photo stand out because it is a Black & White photo. I am hoping users will want to see more after just visiting the home page. Keeping it very minimalist in style. 

This hero image is only an intriduction to my work!

The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for PicNSnip. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer also inclubes a video link icon and a signature. The video link shows my fun side in life, capturing moments in time when I dont have a camera. 

The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media
